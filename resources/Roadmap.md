Implementation Roadmap: ATOM SQ Chord GeneratorThis document outlines the four-phase development strategy for the Max for Live sectional chord progression generator.Phase 1: Hardware Foundation (The "Native" Layer)Goal: Establish reliable two-way communication with the ATOM SQ.[ ] Native Mode Handshake: Verify that live.thisdevice triggers the secret handshake consistently.[ ] SysEx String Formatting: Implement the helper functions to translate ASCII text into the specific 7-bit byte array required for the ATOM SQ screen.[ ] Encoder Delta Logic: Fine-tune the relative CC parsing to ensure no value jumping when switching between parameters.[ ] RGB Feedback: Create a color mapping system where pad brightness or color changes based on the chord's status (e.g., Playing vs. Selected).Phase 2: Theory Engine & State ManagementGoal: Build the "Brain" using the Max 9 V8 engine and the dict system.[ ] Diatonic Stacking: Implement the logic that maps an ATOM SQ pad (MIDI Note) to its corresponding scale degree and default chord quality.[ ] Modal Interchange: Integrate the getBorrowedChord logic to allow encoders to shift the harmonic palette between parallel modes.[ ] Chord Extension Logic: Add the ability to stack 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths dynamically while maintaining the root note.[ ] Persistence: Wire the internal JS object to a dict connected to a pattrstorage object to ensure song sections are saved with the Live project.Phase 3: Sectional Workflow & UIGoal: Enable the user to arrange chords into sequences and sections.[ ] Harmonic Rhythm: Implement encoder control over "Chord Length" (in beats), updating the internal timeline of the current section.[ ] Section Management: Create the UI logic to switch between "Verse," "Chorus," and "Bridge" containers within the master dictionary.[ ] Real-time Preview: Ensure that as the user defines a chord on the hardware, the M4L device generates a low-latency MIDI preview for immediate feedback.Phase 4: Ableton Live API OrchestrationGoal: Physical placement of the generated music into the DAW timeline.[ ] Session Proxy Workflow: Script the automation that creates a temporary MIDI clip in Session View to act as a data buffer.[ ] Arrangement Migration: Implement the duplicate_clip_to_arrangement call to move the finished progression to the correct track and beat time.[ ] DAW State Observation: Use LiveAPI observers to monitor the project's Tempo and Global Transport, ensuring clips are placed exactly on the grid.[ ] Transition Logic: Implement "Backdoor Dominant" or "Plagal" transition presets that can be appended to the end of a section automatically.Future Enhancements[ ] AI-Assisted Voicings: Use the Gemini API to suggest alternative chord voicings based on the preceding section's energy level.[ ] Multi-Controller Support: Expand the Hardware Parser to support the standard ATOM (16-pad) as a secondary input.
